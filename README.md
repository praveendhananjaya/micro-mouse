# micro-mouse

A Micromouse is a small robotic vehicle designed to navigate its way through an unknown maze. It is an autonomous, battery-operated, and self-contained robot that utilizes maze-solving algorithms to find the optimal route with the shortest run time to the center of the maze.

## Wall follower 

micromouse initial testing done by Wall following algorithm.(left-hand rule or the right-hand rule)If the maze is simply connected, that is, all its walls are connected together or to the maze's outer boundary, then by keeping one hand in contact with one wall of the maze the solver is guaranteed not to get lost and will reach a different exit if there is one; otherwise, the algorithm will return to the entrance having traversed every corridor next to that connected section of walls at least once. The algorithm is a depth-first in-order tree traversal.
